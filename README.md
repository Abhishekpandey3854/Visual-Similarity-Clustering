# Visual-Similarity-Clustering

The dataset used for this project is from kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/flower-color-images?]
In this project, I tried to cluster images on the basis of their visual similarity. For extracting the features from images I used VGG16 pre-trained model and used k-means clustering for grouping similar images.
